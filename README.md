# How-To

- Decide on what to do
- Press the button to start the work timer (25 minutes)</li>
- Work until the timer expires. Press the button to turn off the alarm</li>
- Press the button again and take a short break (5 minutes)</li>
- Repeat this process 3 more times, then</li>
- Take a long break (25 minutes)</li>

You can pause the timer at any time with a short press to pause and later resume. Pressing and holding for 2 seconds ends the current phase and moves to the next one.

Note: This action times things differently than the standard Pomodoro method; the fourth break is one long break interval instead of a short break into a long break.
